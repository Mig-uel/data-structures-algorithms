## Analyzing Performance of Arrays and Objects

## Before We Begin

Let's spend a couple of minutes analyzing the things we do all the time in JavaScript: working with Arrays, Objects, and built-in methods.

## Objectives

- Understand how objects and arrays work, through the lens of Big O
- Explain why adding elements to the beginning of an array is costly
- Compare and contrast the runtime for arrays and objects, as well as built-in methods
