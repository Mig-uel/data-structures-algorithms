# Algorithms And Problem Solving Approach

## Objectives

- Define what an algorithm is
- Devise a plan to solve algorithms
- Compare and contrast problem solving patterns including frequency counters, two pointer problems and divide and conquer

## What is an Algorithm?

An algorithm is a process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task.

## Why Do I Need to Know This?

Almost everything that you do in programming involves some kind of algorithm. **It's the foundation for being a successful problem solver and developer.**
Also, it's a common topic in coding interviews.

## How Do You Improve?

1. Devise a plan for solving problems: How do you approach solving problems?
2. Master common problem solving patterns: What are the common patterns that you can use to solve problems?

## Problem Solving Strategies

1. Understand the Problem
2. Explore Concrete Examples
3. Break It Down
4. Solve/Simplify
5. Look Back and Refactor
