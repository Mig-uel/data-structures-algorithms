# Bubble Sort

Sorting is the process of rearranging the items in a collection (e.g. an array) so that the items are in some kind of order.

Examples:

- Sorting numbers from smallest to largest
- Sorting names alphabetically
- Sorting movies based on release year
- Sorting movies based on revenue
- Sorting movies based on ratings

Bubble Sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms available. It is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexity are of ÎŸ(n^2) where n is the number of items.

## Why Do We Need Sorting?

Sorting is an incredibly common task, so it's good to have a basic understanding of how sorting algorithms work.

There are many different ways to sort things, and different techniques have their own advantages and disadvantages.

## Objectives

- Implement bubble sort
- Implement selection sort
- Implement insertion sort
- Understand why it is important to learn these simpler sorting algorithms
